This project contains the starting point used to create the grumpy cat GPT.

It's really hard to code and watch at the same time, which is why this repository exists. Now that you've seen it call come together, give it a try yourself and use this project as a starting point. Once you've got things up and running, ,ake it your own, and change things around, turn this in to a happy puppy app, or something else!

**Side note:** If you don't feel quite up for it, or feeling like you're needing a lot more foundational knowledge before digging in, fret not! We have lots of resources to help you get off the ground and more! Please reach out for more info.
